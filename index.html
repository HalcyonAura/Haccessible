        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>This is a template accessible hackathon event website. Hackathons are often open to all skill levels, background, experiences, genders, and more. That said, we could talk more about having proactive design rather than reactive design, particularly as an a11y.</p>
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <p>A schedule with brief descriptions of each event will help reduce confusion about what to expect.</p>
        <h3>Meal Time Descriptions</h3>
        <p>If possible, provide a menu so those with dietary restrictions and/or allergies can determine if they need to prepare food ahead of time, or if they'll be accommodated (aim for accommodating them though!)</p>

                <p>We always say we're open to everyone, but to actually be a welcoming space requires purposeful (and well executed) intention. To best tackle this, consider designing <strong>with</strong> folks instead of <strong>for</strong> them.</p>

                <p> Not quite. Consider having a well designed website with good contrast and readable fonts, closed captioning at ceremonies and workshops (or shareable transcripts), and ensuring there's ways for people to enter and navigate the building and makeshift walkways (such as the expo hall/judging which is among the most crowded, or getting over power and network cables).</p>

          <h2>Mentors</h2>
            <p>Mentors are sometimes hackers, sometimes community members, but always full of knowledge and willing to help hackers debug their projects. Mentors can be more than just technical help, project managers and folks who focus on other business aspects are great for ideation and scope advice. Even more, they can simulate a possible client interaction making hackers have to learn how to communicate their ideas to different experience levels.</p>

          <span class="anchor" id="speakers"></span>
          <h2>Speakers</h2>
            <p>Speakers are workshop hosts and can give hackers (and other attendees) an hour long tutorial on a possible starter project, expose people to new technologies and their nuances, and talk more about their field or company and what to expect. Workshops can be breaks for hackers, offer chances to find an expert in a topic, and/or provide new connections!</p>

        <h2>Sponsors</h2>
        <div class="sponsor" id="toptier">
          <p>Sponsors give differing amounts of money which allows them certain "features" at a hackathon. Such as the biggest logo for the biggest contribution, and maybe some keynote time!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sponsor" id="secondtier"></div>
        <p>Sponsors who give a little less might get to give a workshop and host a prize category that they'll judge themselves.</p>
        <div class="sponsor" id="thirdtier">
          <p>Sponsors who give a lower amount are still wonderful to have, they'll at least be on the t-shirt if they sponsored in time, and may send mentors or recruiters for only the first day.</p>
